# PortfolioWebsite2
This is my very own portfolio, and you can find it at https://jedsaxon.com. There is not much to cover about the website other than the fact that it uses Bootstrap for the user interface. In the future, I hope to add fancy animations as it might make the website a bit less 'static.'
